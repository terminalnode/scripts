# Scripts
A collection of small scripts I've created, mostly commandline scripts.

Scripts created for a specific purpose, such as being used with a certain
application, are sorted into specific folders. Other scripts can be found
in the `general` folder.

Additional information about the scripts and what they're used for can
be found in the subfolders.
