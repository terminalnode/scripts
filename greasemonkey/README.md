# Greasemonkey scripts
Greasemonkey is a userscript manager, it allows the user to run javascript
on top of websites to alter the way they work or the way they look. It's very
cool. The phenomenal browser [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) also has
built-in support for running them, and that's how I use them.

Because I use them with Qutebrowser you can also find them in my dotfiles,
specifically in
[.local/share/qutebrowser/greasemonkey](https://github.com/terminalnode/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/share/qutebrowser/greasemonkey)

The latest versions of the script will always be at the link above, but
I try to keep this repository up to date with any significant changes because
it's easier to browse.

# Descriptions
* `reddit-mark-read.js` marks posts on Reddit as read when clicking the preview,
which makes procrastrination way more productive. Some links are made to point to
the discussion threads instead since the history-altering method used for marking
links as visited doesn't allow cross-site links.
* `reddit-remove-promoted.js` removes promoted links Reddit. Also removes the Reddit
Premium ad on the right side of the screen.
